# Evolutionary-Robotics-Neuromorphic-SNN
Evolution of a spiking neural network (SNN) embedded in a simulated Epuck robot behaving in an open arena. The SNN is evolved via morphogenesis (evo-devo), reproducing the algorithm described in Roggen, Federici, Floreano (2007) https://doi.org/10.1007/s10710-006-9019-1.
